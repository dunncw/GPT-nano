# Intro: chatGPT, Transformers, nanoGPT, Shakespeare

This video introduces the GPT algorithm and shows how to build it from scratch using code. The algorithm is used to predict the next character in a text sequence, and is implemented as a PyTorch module. The video covers how to set up the model, how to train it, and how to evaluate the results.

- 00:00:00 ChatGPT is a machine learning system that allows users to interact with an AI and give it text-based tasks. The system is based on a neural network that models the sequence of words in a text. 
- This 1-page document(colab file) explains how to build a chatbot using the GPT model. The code is written in Python and can be followed along with on a GitHub repository. Nano GPT is a repository for training Transformers.
- gpt is a system that allows users to interact with an AI through text-based tasks. The system, ChatGPT, is a probabilistic language model that can generate multiple responses to a single prompt. He also mentions the Transformer architecture, which is the neural network that powers ChatGPT, and is a landmark paper in AI from 2017. he also also mentions that the goal is to build a similar system, but instead of training on a large dataset, it will be trained on a smaller dataset called Tiny Shakespeare.

# tokenization, train/validation split
00:10:00 This lecture explains how to tokenize text using a character-level tokenizer, and then use the encoded text as input to a Transformer to learn patterns. The training data is split into a training and validation set, and overfitting is monitored by hiding the validation set.
- he is discussing the process of tokenization, which is the conversion of raw text into a sequence of integers according to a vocabulary of possible elements. he is building a character-level language model, where individual characters are translated into integers. he also mention that there are other tokenization methods, such as Google's sentence piece and OpenAI's tick-tock tokenizer, which can use sub-word units or words instead of individual characters. he also mentions that tokenization will be done using a simple character-level tokenizer in order to keep the code simple, but the sequences will be longer as a result. They are also using Pytorch library's torch.tensor to tokenize the entire training set of Shakespeare, and the data tensor will be a massive sequence of integers representing the text.

# data loader: batches of chunks of data
00:15:00 In this video, the author introduces the concept of a block size and discusses how it affects the efficiency and accuracy of a Transformer network. They also introduce the concept of a batch dimension and show how it affects the processing of blocks of data.
00:20:00 The video provides a step-by-step guide on how to build a GPT algorithm from scratch, using code. The GPT algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that is designed to predict the next character in a text sequence. The algorithm is implemented as a PyTorch module, and is able to predict the logits for every position in a 4x8 tensor.
- summary of section: he is discussing the process of training a Transformer model on a text dataset, specifically the Shakespeare text. he mentions that the entire text will not be fed into the Transformer at once because it would be computationally expensive, instead they will work with chunks of the dataset. These chunks have a maximum length, typically referred to as block size, in this case it is 8. he also mentions that when they sample a chunk of data, it has multiple examples packed into it because the characters follow each other. He also explains that they will train the Transformer on all the examples in the chunk, with context between one and the block size, to make the Transformer network be used to seeing different contexts. he also mentions that during inference, the Transformer will never receive more than block size inputs when it's predicting the next character. He also mentions that there is one more dimension to care about, the batch dimension, which will be discussed later.

# simplest baseline: bigram language model, loss, generation 
00:25:00 In this video, the authors introduce GPT, a loss function for character prediction in PyTorch. They show how to implement GPT using cross entropy, and then show how to evaluate its quality on data.
00:30:00 The video discusses how to build a GPT model from scratch, using code. The model is designed to predict the next character in a text sequence, using a simple forward function. Training the model is accomplished by running the model with a sequence of tokens, and obtaining a loss.
00:35:00 This video discusses how to build a GPT model from scratch, using the SGD optimizer and Adam algorithm. The video covers how to set up the model, how to train it, and how to evaluate the results.
00:40:00 The author introduces a mathematical trick used in self-attention, and explains how it is used in a toy example. They then show how the self-attention algorithm calculates the average of all the vectors in previous tokens.
00:45:00 In this video, the author shows how to build a GPT algorithm in code, using matrix multiplication to be very efficient.
00:50:00 The video introduces the GPT algorithm, which calculates averages of a set of rows in an incremental fashion. The video shows how to vectorize the algorithm using softmax, and why that is useful.
00:55:00 In this video, the author walks through the code for building a GPT model from scratch. The model is based on a triangular matrix where each element is a token, and the tokens can communicate only if they are negative infinity. The model is developed using a number of pre-existing variables and functions, and the author explains how to calculate the logits using a linear layer between the token embeddings and the vocab size.
01:00:00 - 01:55:00
This video demonstrates how to build a self-attention module in code. The module uses a linear layer of interaction to keep track of the attention of a single individual head. The self-attention module is implemented as a tabular matrix, which masks out the weight of each column and then normalizes it to create data-dependent affinities between tokens.

01:00:00 This video demonstrates how to build a self-attention module in code. The module uses a linear layer of interaction to keep track of the attention of a single individual head. The self-attention module is implemented as a tabular matrix, which masks out the weight of each column and then normalizes it to create data-dependent affinities between tokens.
01:05:00 This video demonstrates how to implement a GPT algorithm in code, with a focus on the head of self-attention. The head size is a hyperparameter, and bias is set to false to allow for parallelism. The linear modules are then initialized and a key and query are produced. The communication between nodes is prevented by using upper triangular masking. The weighted aggregation is then data-dependent and produces a distribution with a mean of one.
01:10:00 In this video, "Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out," the author explains the self-attention mechanism, which allows nodes in a directed graph to communicate with each other without needing to know their positions in space.
01:15:00 The video explains how attention works and describes the two types of attention, self-attention and cross-attention. It also shows how to implement attention in code.
01:20:00 In this video, the author explains how to build a GPT network, which is a machine learning model that uses self-attention to improve accuracy. They first discuss how to normalize the data so that it can be processed by the self-attention component, and then they explain how self-attention works and show how to implement it in code. Finally, they demonstrate how multi-head attention is implemented and how the network is trained. The self-attention component helps the network improve its accuracy by communicating with the past more effectively. However, the network still has a long way to go before it is able to produce amazing results.
01:25:00 The video demonstrates how to build a GPT neural network from scratch, using code. The network consists of a feed forward layer followed by a relative nonlinearity, and a self-attention layer. The feed forward layer is sequential, and the self-attention layer is multi-headed. The network is trained using a loss function, and the validation loss decreases as the network gets more complex.
01:30:00 This YouTube video explains how to build a deep neural network (DNN) from scratch, using code. The author introduces the concept of residual connections, which are initialized to be almost "not there" at the beginning of the optimization process, but become active over time. The author also shows how to implement layer norm, a technique that ensures that columns in an input are not normalized, while rows are. Finally, the author demonstrates how to train and optimize a DNN using Pi Torch.
01:35:00 In this video, the author describes how they added a layer of "norms" to their "transformer" (a machine learning model) in order to scale it up. The author also notes that they changed some hyperparameters, and decreased the learning rate, in order to make the model more efficient.
01:40:00 This video explains how a decoder-only Transformer can be used for machine translation, and how it can be improved by adding an encoder. The result is a Transformer that is more similar to the original paper's architecture, which is intended for a different task.
01:45:00 GPT is a model-based encoder-decoder system that is very similar to the model-based encoder-decoder system that was used in the video.
01:50:00 The video and accompanying transcript explain how a GPT (general-purpose data summarizer) was trained on a small data set to summarize documents in a similar fashion to an assistant.
01:55:00 The video summarizes how to build a language model using code, using the GPT model as an example. The model is trained using a supervised learning algorithm, and then fine-tuned using a reward model. There is a lot of room for further refinement, and the video suggests that for more complex tasks, further stages of training may be necessary.
